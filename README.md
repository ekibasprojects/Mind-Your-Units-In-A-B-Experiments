# Mind Your Units In A/B Experiments

This is a bootstrap simulation that demonstrates the importance of accounting for the group structure as opposed to ignoring it in a group-randomized trials when performing causal inference. It is based on the ["Mind Your Units"](https://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2016/08/mind-your-units.html) article published by Google. 

The simulation shows how ignoring the group structure leads to increasingly optimistic inferences, while accounting for the group structure leads to preserving the accurate coverage regardless of group size.
